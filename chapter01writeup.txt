QUESTION 1
1. Based on virustotal.com, do these files match any existing malware signatures?
	-> they look like a trojan
2. When were these files compiled?
	-> since PEview doesn't run on linux, we will use winedump. We see the dll was compiled Dec 19 2010, and the exe the same date
3. Is there evidence the files are packed or obscured?
	-> PEiD doesn't work on linux, but there is
 pepack. pepack says that the dll was packed with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 DLL, and the exe with Microsoft Visual C++, but the solution says neither file was packed? PEiD says the same. Weird, will have to come back to this. 
		-> it turns out that the "packing" with microsoft visual c++ actually implies that the file was NOT packed. 
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does?
	-> looks like my best bet is to use dependency walker with wine (home/depends). Immedietly with the dll we see an error, that there is an unresolved import due to a missing export.
	Interesting Imports:
	DLL
		-> KERNEL32.DLL
			-> CloseHandle
			-> CreateProcessA
			-> sleep
		-> WS2_32.dll is imported, indicating network functionality
	EXE
		-> KERNEL32.DLL
			-> closehandle
			-> CopyFileA
			-> CreateFileA
			-> find close and next file
5,6,7. An IP address is found with the strings command. We also notice that it opens a fake dll file, using a 1 rather than an l, so it is meant to be disguised as a windows dll. I assume the exe file opens a backdoor that is the disguised kernel dll. This is all I can gather using only static techniques. 

QUESTION 2.

1. virustotal lights up like a christmas tree. It apears to be a trojan of some sort.
2. pepack indicates the file was packed with UPX
3. it opens kernel32.dll as well as some others. im not sure if msvcrt.dll or sechost.dll are significant. also setupapi.dll. 
	-> according to the anwers, it also opensservice, opensinternet, and opensinternetURL, but i didnt see these? Will investigate later.
		-> I was looking in the wrong window in dependencywalker, lol.
		-> they're found with the strings command. Need to remember to do this as one of the first steps.4. We should check for a file called MalService. We use upx to unpack the executable. we should also check for uploads to malwareanalysisbook.com, the only url in the strings of the unpacked file. We should assume this is whats opened by openInternetURL


QUESTION 3. 

1. virustotal again lights up; looks like a trojan.
2. a strings command reveals that it loads libraries, get proccess addresses, but thats about it. pepack reveals the exe was packed with FSG. This may be difficult to unpack on linux, and im too lazy to do that now. 
3, 4. As for inputs, CreateFile, CreateTimer, GetConsomeCommandHistory, GetConsoleCursorInfo, GetConsoleInputExeName, (sets for the above), WrietConsoleOutput(and input).

However, very little can be learned because we cant unpack the file. According to the answerkey, this is not because of linux. So im good. 

QUESTION 4. 

1. appears to be a trojan downloader. 
2. pepack says Microsoft Visual C++, so it is not packed. strings reveals it creates a remote trheat, loads some libraries, gets directories, moves files, adjust privileges, and calls the URL practicialmalwareanalysis.com. So it creates a file and hides it, most likely in windows32/wupdmgr.exe
3. compiled Aug 30 2019
4. the imports indicate the above.
5. Honestly have no idea what to do with resourcehacker, will come back to this!
